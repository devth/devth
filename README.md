Growth-minded fullstack software engineer with two decades experience gardening web, mobile, cloud infrastructure and distributed systems. Cares about Developer Experience as much as User Experience. Very interested in making your life easier!

I wield technology to build great products and experiences and strive toward doing exactly that at every layer of the stack:

- iterating on meticulously-detailed frontends for client sites, interactive experiences, and web applications
- at the API level efficiently piping and transforming data between backend and frontend with considerations around concurrency, authn and authz
- at the very back working on a Scala-based in-memory distributed columnar data store for eBay which powered real-time analytics for seller tools
- as a Site Reliability Engineer creating automation, standards, and modern container-based infrastructure in public and private clouds

Strong proponent of using automation to make processes more efficient and repeatable. I build an open source chat bot called Yetibot for this purpose and for fun.

Obsessed with discovering better ways of expressing solutions to programming problems. I abhor unsoundness, boilerplate, repetitive code and senseless abstraction. On a path of ongoing language discovery.

I work remotely on a globally-distributed team for Carta helping build the future of financial infrastructure. I live in Montana with my wife and five kids. Iâ€™m an aspiring electronics tinkerer, musician, climber, mountain biker and cyclist, learner, avid listener of music, and maker of things.
